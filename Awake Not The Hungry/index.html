                <p class="lead">Imagine you are born deaf, blind, unable to speak, with doctors saying you will only live a few months. This
                    is the life of Matthew Wulf. Imagine you are born deaf, blind, unable to speak, with doctors saying you
                    will only live a few months. And then imagine sensing the hand of a loving God reaching toward you as
                    if to say, "I have a purpose for your life, and I will be with you every day of your journey." Matthew
                    Andreas Wulf struggled for life from birth with the rare disorder Zellweger's Syndrome. His body profoundly
                    affected, he worked with tenacity to learn, to discover, to achieve, to live. As he reached up to grasp
                    the hand of God in a hope that will amaze, Matthew kept a record of his writing over six years of his
                    school life, showing his progression in both his learning and his faith. Out of this he formed this book,
                    Awake Not The Hungry, as an effort to make his short life meaningful and inspiring to others who learn
                    of him, and those who struggle with disabilities and challenges bigger than they are. Matthew wants most
                    of all to share an unusual life that has developed his belief in the power of God and His purpose for
                    every life.</p>
